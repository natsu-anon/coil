# COIL
`coil` expands C & C++ function declarations into definitions using tree-sitter, mostly as a little project to familiarize myself _with_ tree-sitter.

Make sure you run `git clone --recursive` to clone the tree-sitter submodules.  Otherwise you'll have to do the following later:
``` bash
git submodule init
git submodule update

```
